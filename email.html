Dear Bhupender,<br><br>
As you might already know,31st May is my last day at work with COLT. <br><br>
It was not an easy decision to make because I truly enjoy working with you here at Colt.<br><br>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support and help, it has helped my career to blossom. I have learned a great deal from you and will miss your company.
It has been a great pleasure working with you.<br>
